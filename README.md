<h2>Instagram Clone</h2>

## InspirationðŸŒ 
 Today, world is full of posts ,vedios of every kind, this makes me curious about how this all works ,it inspires me a lot to make something similar to ,day today's app like instagram, tiktok etc.

## What it doesðŸš€
Instagram clone (commonly abbreviated to IG, Insta or the gram)[is a photo sharing social networking platform.The app allows users to upload media i.e photos that can be likes and disliked.Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers. Users can browse other users' content by tags anview trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add their content to a personal feed.
It is a full stack web application, we made using MERN stack . It first opens with login screen , user need to login if account exists or need to create account if new to platform , after successful signup it redirects user to login screen and now user need to login , that's how the auth works. 
Now after login, home screen appears with lots of posts of users ,they make like ,unlike , or go to any user's profile from home screens posts , may follow and unfollow them as per their preference ,see the gallery of other peoples ,and if they wish to make a new post they may select create post camera icon from home screen.
Also the search icon is at top ,if someone want to find their friend and wants to connect, they may make use of search feature.
Most lovingly if user want to appreciate someone's post they may comment on the post and express themselves.
And finally they can logout the app if they want using logout button.

I started off by creating a prototype in **Figma**. The mobile application was built using **MERN stack** and **VS-Stusio** as tool. We made use of **JWT(javascript web token)** for authentication and for saving user data.I used **cloudinary api** for image storage and **sendgrid api** for sending welcome emails. And finally deplyed at **heroku**.

## Challenges We ran intoðŸ”´
 I was very new to **JWT** authentication ,I really find it difficult to integrate it with web app,then at deployment time(It was my fist deployment with heroku) too much difficulty     arises because of secure keys ,which was very new to me and i was not aware about, how to hide them before production.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud ofðŸŽ–
I am able to create our proper authentication system along with forget passward option which I never really tried before. I also explored JWT ,cloudanary api,sendgrid api in a deep way and got to understand how a few things worked a particular way. At last how to deploy web application to heroku.
## What I learnedðŸ“š
I got more experience in **MERN stack and JWT** by building this application.  Got to learn about different authentication systems and how everything interacts in the web application during auth. I also wished to integrate vedio  in the app and hence got a chance to work around how vedio solution parse using url .And how to integrate diifferent apis in web application.

## What's next for Instagram CloneðŸŽ‰
The current point system that I have is dynamic but I would love to introduce vedios and story feature options into the application to make the whole experience even more rewarding.
